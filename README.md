# Go Infinite Rail Generator

The Go Infinite Rail Generator procedurally generates a *one-dimensional* rail word. *One-dimensional*
in this context means that the world is practically infinite, 
to the left, and the right, like an infinite gift ribbon. In reality, the map spans 19 times the earth's equatorial perimeter.

Currently, the generator is work in progress and will be improved.
